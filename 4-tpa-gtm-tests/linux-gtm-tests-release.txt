Parameterized test suite ExternalInstantiationTest is instantiated via INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P, but no tests are defined via TEST_P . No test cases will run.

Ideally, INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P should only ever be invoked from code that always depend on code that provides TEST_P. Failing to do so is often an indication of dead code, e.g. the last TEST_P was removed but the rest got left behind.

To suppress this error for this test suite, insert the following line (in a non-header) in the namespace it is defined in:

GTEST_ALLOW_UNINSTANTIATED_PARAMETERIZED_TEST(ExternalInstantiationTest);

Parameterized test suite InstantiationInMultipleTranslationUnitsTest is instantiated via INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P, but no tests are defined via TEST_P . No test cases will run.

Ideally, INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P should only ever be invoked from code that always depend on code that provides TEST_P. Failing to do so is often an indication of dead code, e.g. the last TEST_P was removed but the rest got left behind.

To suppress this error for this test suite, insert the following line (in a non-header) in the namespace it is defined in:

GTEST_ALLOW_UNINSTANTIATED_PARAMETERIZED_TEST(InstantiationInMultipleTranslationUnitsTest);
